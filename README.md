## Description
I personally test this on my own device to make sure nothing breaks.

If you would like to see a list of apps this script can remove check out App List.txt

This is a PowerShell script that uses the ADB to uninstall bloatware from Samsung devices.
It askes you if you would like to remove it on the way.

Note: Never run scripts without reading them & understanding what they do.

&nbsp;

## Usage
If you would just like to run the script as it is run the following command in powershell (Run it as a administrator):

          powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JkvBP')"

If you want to edit the script feel free to download it and run it.
