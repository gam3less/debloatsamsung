## Description

This is a PowerShell script for automation of routine tasks done after fresh installations of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 / 2019. This is by no means any complete set of all existing Windows tweaks and neither is it another "antispying" type of script. It's simply a setting which I like to use and which in my opinion make the system less obtrusive.

&nbsp;

## Usage
If you would just like to run the script as it is run the following command in powershell:

  powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JTrqX')"
